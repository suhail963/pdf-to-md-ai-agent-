Task Sheet: PDF to Structured
## Markdown Convertor
## Document Information
Company: Textro AI
## Version: 0.2
## Date: May 1, 2025
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that converts PDF documents into struc-
tured Markdown (.md) format. The system will extract relevant text from PDF files,
eliminate unnecessary content, and produce a clean Markdown document, maintaining
logical structure such as headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
## Phased Approach
- Phase 1: Development of the standalone PDF to Markdown conversion system.
- Phase 2: Integration of the conversion logic into a Flask-based REST API.
## Phase 1: Conversion System Design
## Pipeline Design
The system must be designed as a modular pipeline with the following stages:
1. Input handling
2. Text extraction
3. Preprocessing and cleaning
4. Structuring and formatting
5. Output writing
## Project Requirements
1. PDF Input:
a. The system must accept standard PDF files either through file upload or by
specifying a file path.
## 2. Text Extraction:
a. Extract readable and clean text from the PDF document.
b. Ensure the hierarchy and context of the document is preserved (e.g., titles,
subheadings, bullet points).
## 3. Information Filtering:
a. The system must remove the following elements from the document:
i. Page numbers
ii. Headers and footers
iii. Irrelevant metadata
iv. Repeated template sections
## 4. Structured Formatting:
a. The output must be formatted in Markdown (.md) format.
b. The system should use appropriate Markdown syntax, including:
i. #, #, # for headings and subheadings
ii. - or * for bullet points
iii. bold for key terms (optional)
## 5. Extensibility:
a. The system should be designed to be extensible, allowing for handling of dif-
ferent PDF formats and layouts in future iterations.
## Deliverables (Phase 1)
1. A fully functional Python codebase for PDF to Markdown conversion.
2. A sample PDF input document and the corresponding Markdown output.
3. A system architecture diagram illustrating the conversion pipeline.
Phase 2: API Integration using Flask
In the second phase, the core PDF-to-Markdown conversion logic developed in Phase 1
will be exposed via a Flask-based REST API. A simple HTML/CSS frontend will be
built to interact with the API, and Postman will be used for API testing and validation.
API Requirements
## 1. Framework:
a. Use the Flask web framework (Python) to develop a RESTful API.
## 2. Endpoints:
a. POST /convert
Accepts a PDF file (multipart/form-data), runs the conversion pipeline, and
returns the Markdown text.
b. GET /health
A simple health check endpoint that returns service status.
## 3. Error Handling:
a. Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 500) for invalid inputs or
server errors.
b. JSON responses must include a success flag and a descriptive message.
c. Example error response:
## {
"success": false,
"message": "Invalid file format. Please upload a PDF."
## }
## 4. Frontend:
a. A minimal frontend built using HTML and CSS for uploading PDF files and
displaying Markdown output.
b. Use JavaScript (optional) for asynchronous form submission and displaying
results.
5. API Testing:
a. Use Postman to test API endpoints.
b. Verify correct behavior with valid and invalid inputs.
c. Save test cases in a shared collection for team use.
## 6. Security:
a. Validate uploaded files (e.g., check MIME type and extension).
b. Limit file size to prevent abuse (e.g., 5MB max).
## Deliverables (Phase 2)
1. A REST API implemented using Flask for PDF-to-Markdown conversion.
2. HTML/CSS frontend for user interaction with the API.
3. Postman test collection with example API requests and test results.
4. API documentation (e.g., Swagger or Markdown file).
